NetSoc is a new society at Sheffield Hallam put together for the networking students by the networking students! The society is manned by the committee below. The society aims to provide a centralised place for all things networking. We will be running various sessions throughout the year from a variety of areas from both internal and external speakers. Mentoring is provided as well on anything related to the course and those wishing to pursue certifications. Trips are also planned such as organisation visits and any other interesting events!
